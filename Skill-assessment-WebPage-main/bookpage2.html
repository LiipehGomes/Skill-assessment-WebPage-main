      <h2>The Catcher in the Rye</h2>
      <p>"The Catcher in the Rye," written by J.D. Salinger and published in 1951, is a classic American novel that
        explores themes of teenage angst and alienation. The story is narrated by Holden Caulfield, a 16-year-old boy
        who has just been expelled from his latest prep school, Pencey Prep. Disillusioned and feeling disconnected from
        the world around him, Holden decides to leave school early and spend a few days in New York City before
        returning home to face his parents.

        Throughout the novel, Holden describes his interactions with various people, including old friends, teachers,
        and strangers. He is highly critical of the adult world, which he sees as "phony" and superficial. His journey
        through the city is marked by a deep sense of loneliness and a longing for genuine human connection. Holden's
        younger sister, Phoebe, is one of the few people he feels he can truly communicate with, and his love for her is
        one of the novel's central elements.

        Holden's desire to protect the innocence of children is symbolized by his fantasy of being "the catcher in the
        rye," a guardian who saves children from falling into the corruption of adulthood. This metaphor is derived from
        a misinterpretation of Robert Burns' poem "Comin' Thro' the Rye," which Holden recalls when he hears a child
        singing the song.

        The novel ends ambiguously with Holden in a mental institution, reflecting on his experiences and expressing a
        vague hope for the future. He plans to attend a new school in the fall, but his future remains uncertain.

        "The Catcher in the Rye" is celebrated for its candid and nuanced portrayal of teenage confusion and rebellion.
        It has resonated with generations of readers, who find in Holden Caulfield a voice that articulates the
        struggles of growing up and the search for identity and meaning in a seemingly indifferent world.</p>
