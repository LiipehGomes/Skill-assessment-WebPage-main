            <h2>The Great Gatsby</h2>
            <p>"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a classic American novel set in the 1920s. It tells the story of Jay Gatsby, a wealthy and enigmatic man who throws extravagant parties in hopes of reuniting with his lost love, Daisy Buchanan. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and World War I veteran, who rents a house next to Gatsby's mansion in West Egg, Long Island.

              Nick learns that Gatsby, originally James Gatz from North Dakota, reinvented himself to escape his impoverished past. Gatsby and Daisy had a brief romantic relationship during World War I, but she married Tom Buchanan, a wealthy and arrogant man. Gatsby's wealth and lavish lifestyle are part of his effort to win Daisy back.
              
              Throughout the novel, Gatsby's obsession with Daisy leads him to make increasingly desperate attempts to rekindle their romance. Daisy, however, is torn between her loyalty to Tom and her feelings for Gatsby. Tom, aware of Gatsby's intentions, reveals Gatsby's dubious business dealings in an attempt to discredit him.
              
              Tragedy strikes when Daisy, driving Gatsby's car, accidentally kills Myrtle Wilson, Tom's mistress. Gatsby takes the blame to protect Daisy. Myrtle's husband, George Wilson, believing Gatsby to be responsible for his wife's death, fatally shoots Gatsby before killing himself.
              
              In the aftermath, Gatsby's dream of a future with Daisy crumbles. Daisy and Tom retreat into their world of wealth and privilege, leaving Nick disillusioned. He organizes Gatsby's funeral, which is sparsely attended, highlighting the emptiness of Gatsby's life despite his riches.
              
              Nick returns to the Midwest, reflecting on the moral decay and superficiality of the East Coast elite. "The Great Gatsby" explores themes of idealism, social change, and the American Dream's corruption. Gatsby's tragic end underscores the novel's critique of the pursuit of wealth and status at the expense of genuine human connections and moral integrity.</p>
